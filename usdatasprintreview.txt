20:00:55 From  Sofia Mikheeva  to  Everyone : the only thing i didn’t really get (but do agree with) is stopping the traffic on DA, while the new free track is to cover kind of DA and DS, but was designed for DA
20:00:56 From  Zakhari Bullard  to  Everyone : TESLA
20:01:43 From  Andrey Melnichenko  to  Everyone : April O'Neil
20:02:03 From  Anton Eremin  to  Everyone : Sofa, it’s a hypothesis for now, but bottom line is Americans don’t make distinction between our DA and DS, it’s all data science to them
20:02:13 From  Alena Kozhevnikova  to  Everyone : why does it say «dropped out»?

20:09:56 From  Zakhari Bullard  to  Everyone : HR says they should have fired first
20:10:12 From  Alena Kozhevnikova  to  Everyone : they also fired all the real analysts
20:10:29 From  Alena Kozhevnikova  to  Everyone : that’s why anton wants us to deal with these numbers ourselves

20:12:29 From  Alena Kozhevnikova  to  Everyone : not really, i want conclusions
20:12:40 From  Alena Kozhevnikova  to  Everyone : like «this
20:12:54 From  Anton Eremin  to  Everyone : That’s the thing
20:13:06 From  Alena Kozhevnikova  to  Everyone : wait a sec
20:13:11 From  Anton Eremin  to  Everyone : We can do conclusions ourselves
20:13:23 From  Alena Kozhevnikova  to  Everyone : it’s for web, isn’t it
20:13:35 From  Anton Eremin  to  Everyone : It’s for Russian backend profession
20:13:55 From  Alena Kozhevnikova  to  Everyone : do we have it for data?
20:14:09 From  Mike Cole  to  Everyone : that's why Andrey shaved his head
20:14:12 From  Anton Eremin  to  Everyone : No, but we can ask for it if you want to
