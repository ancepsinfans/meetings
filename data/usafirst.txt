19:02:40 From  Polina Anisimova  to  Everyone : Yandex is coming back to office
19:02:50 From  Elena Chernovich  to  Everyone : I wonder what team is it?
19:03:28 From  Anton Eremin  to  Everyone : This space used to be Yandex Money’s, then they dispersed and covid started so this space goes through changes on its own I guess
19:03:40 From  Anton Eremin  to  Everyone : Well, we had our fun there
19:04:08 From  Anton Eremin  to  Everyone : Lera looks like she has a date after this
19:05:15 From  Jayde  to  Everyone : Good song choice! :)
19:05:22 From  Polina Anisimova  to  Everyone : afaik Yandex is reserving about half of the office space for coworking space for those who’re not coming to office every day
19:05:56 From  Maria Shchur  to  Everyone : Hey awesome team 🙌 thx for music
19:06:05 From  Natalia  to  Everyone : <3

19:13:08 From  Maria Shchur  to  Everyone : ++
19:13:30 From  Anton Eremin  to  Everyone : Steffan I mentioned Launchschool but no luck yet
19:14:32 From  Нюта Блиничева  to  Everyone : Steffan,Anton, we’ll try to find their students
19:14:51 From  Lera Shelegina  to  Everyone : Im registered in their Slack workspace
19:15:50 From  Lera Shelegina  to  Everyone : It was easy to do, plenty of students there, but im not sure their policy allows to invite students for interview in their slack
19:16:27 From  Mike Cole  to  Everyone : practicum graduates make a billion dollars a year!
19:19:06 From  Daria Borisenko-Orlowski  to  Everyone : have we been considering ISAs?
19:19:35 From  Mike Cole  to  Everyone : they're used in Israel, I believe
19:19:44 From  Steffan Warren  to  Everyone : Yep
19:19:52 From  Steffan Warren  to  Everyone : And we’re considering doing it in the US
19:20:36 From  Richard Turner  to  Everyone : The bootcamp vs. degree thing is interesting
19:20:59 From  Daria Borisenko-Orlowski  to  Everyone : I'm on an ISA with a bootcamp if anyone ever needs my experience with it
19:23:24 From  Mariana Ilinova  to  Everyone : We have a tutor who has studied in DevMontain Bootcamp. Maybe he agree to share his experience there ...
19:25:43 From  Anton Eremin  to  Everyone : Springboard use datacamp
19:28:33 From  Anton Eremin  to  Everyone : We’re thinking about launching a few ISA cohorts. I think showing these cohorts in our main product could be a good way to send the message that we’re sure about our students’ results.
19:30:53 From  Polina Anisimova  to  Everyone : Sounds cool, and I guess this message especially valuable (and familiar?) for US students
19:32:24 From  Polina Anisimova  to  Everyone : So they made their own Glassdoor?
19:32:40 From  Нюта Блиничева  to  Everyone : Sounds like that)

19:35:44 From  Polina Anisimova  to  Everyone : Lets schedule this
19:36:40 From  Anton Eremin  to  Everyone : I think we did a shitton of experiments on zoom parties and such and then got bored
19:38:47 From  Polina Anisimova  to  Everyone : Where did she get her degree?
19:38:58 From  Anton Eremin  to  Everyone : They don’t even have code reviews god dammit
19:39:05 From  Anton Eremin  to  Everyone : What’s practical about this
19:40:06 From  Polina Anisimova  to  Everyone : I mean maybe her institution was just very low-level
19:40:26 From  Anton Eremin  to  Everyone : We talk about bootcamps
19:40:31 From  Anton Eremin  to  Everyone : Not university
19:40:32 From  Polina Anisimova  to  Everyone : And then we could search more for those who got shitty degrees
19:41:01 From  Anton Eremin  to  Everyone : I mean, some bootcamps don’t have code reviews, not just unis
19:42:59 From  Anton Eremin  to  Everyone : We need learning experience so good that students would get hired right after they complete first task
19:43:00 From  Elena Chernovich  to  Everyone : Here is the link to my research https://www.notion.so/praktikum/Findings-competitor-bootcamps-7654158046ff4461a4204392c36d96cf#7663825c38fa4601bde6b071403e800c
19:43:23 From  Anton Eremin  to  Everyone : That would be a unique frickin value proposition
19:44:34 From  Elena Chernovich  to  Everyone : Here is a quote to support Anton) I told to someone who used to go to the same school to the same computer science program, and now they are looking for a job and they can not find a job because they don't know what they are doing and I told them, and I was like - hey, they are like actually teaching stuff in this bootcamp, I am actually learning, and I am pretty sure if I were to find a job right now, I would get a job. And I am only half way through. I told him specifically because I know he also has a terrible degree that did not teach him anything
19:44:41 From  Elena Chernovich  to  Everyone : About App Academy
19:46:11 From  Anton Eremin  to  Everyone : Practicum experiment scene became so big that there’s a need for merge and acquisitions

19:54:15 From  Richard Turner  to  Everyone : First university, next, “The system"
19:54:17 From  Anton Eremin  to  Everyone : Lambda School goes for that message and it doesn’t work that well
19:54:20 From  Richard Turner  to  Everyone : Burn it all down
19:54:40 From  Daria Borisenko-Orlowski  to  Everyone : I have friends with CS degrees who work as programmers but that's mostly for data science
19:54:43 From  Daria Borisenko-Orlowski  to  Everyone : robotics
19:54:47 From  Mike Cole  to  Everyone : college is for monks and hunks
19:54:51 From  Daria Borisenko-Orlowski  to  Everyone : other stuff where you need serious math
19:54:54 From  Daria Borisenko-Orlowski  to  Everyone : not web dev
19:55:10 From  Anton Eremin  to  Everyone : College is for getting interested in philosophy
19:55:13 From  Richard Turner  to  Everyone : We’re anti-math now
