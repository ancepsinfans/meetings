13:58:07 From  Andrey Melnichenko  to  Everyone : OKAY
13:59:54 From  Mike Cole  to  Everyone : maybe not so much "native" as "with experience in the established bootcamp market"?

14:17:24 From  pink muthafukka  to  Everyone : i mean what would be a better application of his skills
14:18:00 From  Zakhari Bullard  to  Everyone : I'm not sure, I only know him in a limited capacity for now. Do you have something you'd rather him do?
14:18:03 From  Mike Cole  to  Everyone : so maybe ask Alex to do a SQL deep-dive, compare with Dima's new course outline?
14:18:07 From  Zakhari Bullard  to  Everyone : Don't let me monopolize him
14:18:44 From  pink muthafukka  to  Everyone : let’s talk about it later
14:18:54 From  Zakhari Bullard  to  Everyone : sure. just slide into my DMs
14:19:28 From  Zakhari Bullard  to  Everyone : Mike, I agree that that should be Alex's first concern now that he's coming on board
14:20:55 From  Mike Cole  to  Everyone : the only question is - what's next? if he agrees that Dima's plan is good, will we wait for the Russian side, or... ?
14:21:16 From  Zakhari Bullard  to  Everyone : I think we can't trust the RU
14:21:35 From  Zakhari Bullard  to  Everyone : They don't have an impulse to move
14:21:36 From  pink muthafukka  to  Everyone : is Dima not going to write the course?
14:21:36 From  Mike Cole  to  Everyone : I think things are different with Dima
14:21:50 From  Zakhari Bullard  to  Everyone : If they are different, they will be different with him
14:21:51 From  Mike Cole  to  Everyone : no, they're hiring a SQL writer now
14:22:03 From  pink muthafukka  to  Everyone : the russians?
14:22:11 From  Mike Cole  to  Everyone : yeah

14:22:38 From  pink muthafukka  to  Everyone : a russian writer?
14:23:22 From  Mike Cole  to  Everyone : yeah, it's going to be really gloomy and existential SQL
14:23:36 From  pink muthafukka  to  Everyone : finally
14:26:23 From  pink muthafukka  to  Everyone : we need a skill map
14:26:28 From  Zakhari Bullard  to  Everyone : ++++++++++++++
14:26:43 From  pink muthafukka  to  Everyone : and after every sprint we show where they are on that map

14:27:07 From  pink muthafukka  to  Everyone : do you care, Andrey?
14:27:14 From  Zakhari Bullard  to  Everyone : checked out
14:27:15 From  pink muthafukka  to  Everyone : do you even care???
14:27:27 From  Mike Cole  to  Everyone : there was an attempt at a skill map in the new free course
14:27:46 From  pink muthafukka  to  Everyone : key word attempt
14:27:53 From  Zakhari Bullard  to  Everyone : can we include it in their main page or their lichniy kabinet
14:28:16 From  pink muthafukka  to  Everyone : let’s ask Artemiy Lebedev to draw this map for us
14:28:28 From  Mike Cole  to  Everyone : maybe, but it could involve platform adjustments, which don't happen quickly
14:28:45 From  Zakhari Bullard  to  Everyone : also true
14:30:52 From  Mike Cole  to  Everyone : I have a card on that
14:30:57 From  Mike Cole  to  Everyone : light yellow

14:36:26 From  Zakhari Bullard  to  Everyone : just to keep in mind
14:37:44 From  Mike Cole  to  Everyone : we can do with Russian authors, but in general everything goes more smoothly with ENers
14:37:52 From  Zakhari Bullard  to  Everyone : Agreed
14:37:57 From  Zakhari Bullard  to  Everyone : just $$
14:38:07 From  Mike Cole  to  Everyone : yeah
14:39:00 From  Mike Cole  to  Everyone : Kirill/Anton? are they "content" people?
14:39:28 From  pink muthafukka  to  Everyone : Anton is a content person
14:39:33 From  pink muthafukka  to  Everyone : Kirill not so much
